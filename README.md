# Plotly, the Universe and Me

An interactive Sunburst plot using Plotly, another interesting and flexible Python library for Data Visualization.

For this project, unlike the previous ones, I did not attend any online courses to learn how to use this library. The challenge was to read the official documentation -which can be particularly complex and involve several pages- and find the way to reach the objectives on my own.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:** Given that this particular Jupyter Notebook is considerably heavy (approximately 4 MB), it is very likely that GitHub will not able to execute it. If that is the case, please follow [this link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/palaciodaniel/plotly_the_universe_and_me/blob/main/plotly_the_universe_and_me.ipynb).

I also created a [Binder environment](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/palaciodaniel/plotly_the_universe_and_me/main?filepath=plotly_the_universe_and_me.ipynb) in case you want to experiment by altering the plot's parameters. If by any chance the plot is not displayed when you load the Notebook, please go to **Kernel > Restart and Run All** and that should be enough.
